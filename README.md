## Capsue Generative Adversarial Network 

This is a Tensorflow implementation of Generative Adversarial Network integrated with Capsule Network to generate MNIST Dataset. I have submitted this has my mini project for 8 credits course in my college. Further improvements will be done. Some sample images generated by the Capsule GAN model is shown below.
